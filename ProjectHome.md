Paint.Open is intended to be a fork of Paint.NET. It starts from the latest open source code of Paint.NET, that is version 3.36.7.

Current stage:
Making the source code available to everyone.

Next stage:
Get some people interested in reviewing the code and to put it in shape to start from.

Future stages:
Well... develop a stable version of Paint.Open.
Help to create linux and mac ports.
